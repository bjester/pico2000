%PS2000_IC_GENERIC_DRIVER_GETBLOCK Code for communicating with an instrument. 
%  
%   This is a modified version of the machine generated representation of 
%   an instrument control session using a device object. The instrument 
%   control session comprises all the steps you are likely to take when 
%   communicating with your instrument. These steps are:
%       
%       1. Create a device object   
%       2. Connect to the instrument 
%       3. Configure properties 
%       4. Invoke functions 
%       5. Disconnect from the instrument 
%  
%   To run the instrument control session, type the name of the file,
%   PS2000_IC_Generic_Driver_GetBlock, at the MATLAB command prompt.
% 
%   The file, PS2000_IC_GENERIC_DRIVER_GETBLOCK.M must be on your MATLAB 
%   PATH. For additional information on setting your MATLAB PATH, type 
%   'help addpath' at the MATLAB command prompt.
%
%   Example:
%       PS2000_IC_Generic_Driver_GetBlock;
%
%   Description:
%       Demonstrates how to call functions in order to collect a block of 
%       samples.
