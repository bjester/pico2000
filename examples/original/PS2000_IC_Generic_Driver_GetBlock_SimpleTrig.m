% Description:
%   This is a MATLAB script that demonstrates how to use the
%   PicoScope 2000 series Instrument Control Toobox driver to collect
%   a block of samples.
%
%   A part of this script was generated using the Test and Measurement
%   Tool.
%
% Example:
%    Collect a block of samples after setting the parameters for the
%    channels, sampling interval and simple trigger.
%
%	To run this script:
%		
%   Click 'Run' in the MATLAB Editor or type the name of the file,
%   PS2000_IC_Generic_Driver_GetBlock_SimpleTrig, at the MATLAB command 
%   prompt.
%
%   The file, PS2000_IC_GENERIC_DRIVER_GETBLOCK_SIMPLETRIG.M must be on 
%   your MATLAB PATH. For additional information on setting your MATLAB 
%   PATH, type 'help addpath' at the MATLAB command prompt.

%   Creation time: 04-Jan-2013 17:01:11 
%   Update 01-Nov-2013 for new PicoScope 2204A & 2205A
%   Update 06-Nov-2013 - modified after groups added to Instrument Driver.
